The volcano3D package enables exploration of probes differentially 
expressed between three groups. Its main purpose is for the
visualisation of differentially expressed genes in a three-dimensional
volcano plot. These plots can be converted to interactive visualisations using
plotly. 

The [vignette](https://katrionagoldmann.github.io/volcano3D/articles/Extended_Vignette.html) 
explores a case study from the PEAC 
rheumatoid arthritis trial (Pathobiology of Early Arthritis Cohort). 
The methodology has been published in 
[Lewis, Myles J., et al. _Molecular portraits of early rheumatoid arthritis 
identify clinical and treatment response phenotypes_. Cell reports 28.9 (2019): 
2455-2470.
(DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2019.07.091)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.07.091)
with an interactive web tool available at 
[https://peac.hpc.qmul.ac.uk](https://peac.hpc.qmul.ac.uk).  

This tool acts as a searchable interface to examine relationships between 
individual synovial and blood gene transcript levels and histological, clinical, 
and radiographic parameters, and clinical response at 6 months. 
An interactive interface allows the gene module analysis to be explored for 
relationships between modules and clinical parameters. 
The PEAC interactive web tool was creating as an 
[R Shiny app](https://shiny.rstudio.com) and deployed to the web using a server.
